            <div class="centralTable">
                <p>Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson CBE (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish former football manager and
                    player, widely known for managing Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. He is considered by many to
                    be one of the greatest managers of all time[6][7][8][9] and he has won more trophies than any other
                    manager in the history of football.</p>

                <p>Ferguson played as a forward for several Scottish clubs, including Dunfermline Athletic and Rangers.
                    While playing for Dunfermline, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league in the 1965–66
                    season. Towards the end of his playing career he also worked as a coach, then started his managerial
                    career with East Stirlingshire and St Mirren. Ferguson then enjoyed a highly successful period as
                    manager of Aberdeen, winning three Scottish league championships, four Scottish Cups and the UEFA
                    Cup Winners' Cup in 1983. He briefly managed Scotland following the death of Jock Stein, taking the
                    team to the 1986 World Cup.</p>

                <p>Ferguson was appointed manager of Manchester United in November 1986. During his 26 years with
                    Manchester United he won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA
                    Champions League titles.[12] He was knighted in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours list for his
                    services to the game.[13] Ferguson is the longest-serving manager of Manchester United, having
                    overtaken Sir Matt Busby's record on 19 December 2010. He retired from management at the end of the
                    2012–13 season, having won the Premier League in his final season.</p>
                <p>Born to Alexander Beaton Ferguson, a plater's helper in the shipbuilding industry, and his wife,
                    Elizabeth (née Hardie),[14] Alexander Chapman Ferguson was born at his grandmother's home on
                    Shieldhall Road in Govan, a suburb of Glasgow, on 31 December 1941, but grew up in a tenement at 667
                    Govan Road (which has since been demolished), where he lived with his parents and his younger
                    brother Martin.[15]</p>

                <p>Ferguson attended Broomloan Road Primary School and later Govan High School.[16] He began his
                    football career with Harmony Row Boys Club in Govan,[17][18] before progressing to Drumchapel
                    Amateurs, a youth club with a strong reputation for producing senior footballers.[19] He also took
                    an apprenticeship as a toolmaker at a factory in Hillington, being appointed a union shop
                    steward.[17]</p>

                <div class="textBlock">
                    <p>Ferguson's playing career began as an amateur with Queen's Park, where he made his debut as a
                        striker, aged 16.[20] He described his first match as a "nightmare",[21] but scored Queen's
                        Park's goal in a 2–1 defeat against Stranraer. Perhaps his most notable game for Queen's Park
                        was the 7–1 defeat away to Queen of the South on Boxing Day 1959 when ex-England international
                        Ivor Broadis scored four of the Queen of the South goals. Ferguson was the solitary Queen's Park
                        goalscorer.[22]</p>

                    <p>Despite scoring 20 goals in his 31 games for Queen's Park, he could not command a regular place
                        in the side and moved to St Johnstone in 1960. Although he continued to score regularly at St
                        Johnstone, he was still unable to command a regular place and regularly requested transfers.
                        Ferguson was out of favour at the club and he even considered emigrating to Canada,[23] however
                        St Johnstone's failure to sign a forward led the manager to select Ferguson for a match against
                        Rangers, in which he scored a hat-trick in a surprise victory. Dunfermline signed him the
                        following summer (1964), and Ferguson became a full-time professional footballer.</p>

                    <p>The following season (1964–65), Dunfermline were strong challengers for the Scottish League and
                        reached the Scottish Cup Final, but Ferguson was dropped for the final after a poor performance
                        in a league game against St Johnstone. Dunfermline lost the final 3–2 to Celtic, then failed to
                        win the League by one point. The 1965–66 season saw Ferguson notch up 45 goals in 51 games for
                        Dunfermline. Along with Joe McBride of Celtic, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league
                        with 31 goals.[24]</p>

                    <p>He then joined Rangers for £65,000, then a record fee for a transfer between two Scottish clubs.
                        He performed well in Europe during his two seasons with the club, scoring six goals in nine
                        appearances in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup including two against 1.FC Köln in the 1967–68
                        competition, and an important strike against Athletic Bilbao in the 1968–69 edition which helped
                        Rangers into the semi-finals,[25] but on both occasions they were knocked out by English
                        opposition. He was blamed for a goal conceded in the 1969 Scottish Cup Final,[26] in a match in
                        which he was designated to mark Celtic captain, Billy McNeill, and was subsequently forced to
                        play for the club's junior side instead of for the first team.[27] According to his brother,
                        Ferguson was so upset by the experience that he threw his losers' medal away.[28] There have
                        been claims that he suffered discrimination at Rangers after his marriage to a Catholic, Cathy
                        Holding,[29] but Ferguson himself makes it clear in his autobiography[30] that Rangers knew of
                        his wife's religion when he joined the club and that he left the club very reluctantly, due to
                        the fall-out from his alleged cup final mistake.</p>

                    <p>The following October, Nottingham Forest wanted to sign Ferguson,[31] but his wife was not keen
                        on moving to England at that time so he went to Falkirk instead. He remained at Brockville for
                        four years gaining more league appearances than he had elsewhere; in light of his experience he
                        was promoted to player-coach, but when John Prentice became manager he removed Ferguson's
                        coaching responsibilities. Ferguson's time at Falkirk was soured by this and he responded by
                        requesting a transfer and moved to Ayr United, where he finished his playing career in
                        1974.[32]</p>

                <div class="textBlock">
                    <p>In June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, at the comparatively young
                        age
                        of 32. It was a part-time job that paid £40 per week, and the club did not have a single
                        goalkeeper
                        at the time.[33] He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian, with club forward Bobby McCulley
                        later
                        saying he had "never been afraid of anyone before but Ferguson was a frightening bastard from
                        the
                        start."[34].The following October, Ferguson was invited to manage St Mirren. While they were
                        below East
                        Stirlingshire in the league, they were a bigger club and although Ferguson felt a degree of
                        loyalty
                        towards East Stirlingshire, he decided to join St Mirren after taking advice from Jock
                        Stein.[35]</p>

                <div class="textBlock">
                    Ferguson was manager of St Mirren from 1974 until 1978, producing a remarkable transformation of a
                    team in the lower half of the old Second Division watched by crowds of just over 1,000, to First
                    Division champions in 1977, discovering talent like Billy Stark, Tony Fitzpatrick, Lex Richardson,
                    Frank McGarvey, Bobby Reid and Peter Weir while playing superb attacking football.[36] The average
                    age of the league winning team was 19 and the captain, Fitzpatrick, was 20.[37]</p>

                    <p>St Mirren have the distinction of being the only club ever to sack Ferguson. He claimed wrongful
                        dismissal against the club at an industrial tribunal but lost and was given no leave to appeal.
                        According to a Billy Adams Sunday Herald article on 30 May 1999, the official version is that
                        Ferguson was sacked for various breaches of contract including unauthorised payments to
                        players.[36]
                        He was counter-accused of intimidating behaviour towards his office secretary because he wanted
                        players to get some expenses tax free. He did not speak to her for six weeks, confiscated her
                        keys
                        and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant. The tribunal concluded that Ferguson was
                        "particularly petty" and "immature".[38] It was claimed during the tribunal by St Mirren
                        chairman,
                        Willie Todd, that Ferguson had "no managerial ability".[39]</p>

                    <p>In 2008, The Guardian published an interview with Todd (then aged 87), who had sacked Ferguson
                        many
                        years earlier. Todd explained that the fundamental reason for the dismissal was a breach of
                        contract
                        relating to Ferguson having agreed to join Aberdeen. Ferguson told journalist Jim Rodger of the
                        Daily Mirror that he had asked at least one member of the squad to go to Aberdeen with him. He
                        told
                        the St Mirren staff he was leaving. Todd expressed regret over what happened but blamed Aberdeen
                        for
                        not approaching his club to discuss compensation.[40]</p>

                    <p>In 1977, Ferguson turned down the manager's job at Aberdeen. The role went to Billy McNeill, who
                        returned to Celtic after only a year, leaving the role available for Ferguson once
                        again.[41]</p>

                <div class="textBlock">
                    Ferguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978, replacing Billy McNeill who had only managed
                    the
                    club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage Celtic. Although Aberdeen were
                    one of
                    Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday. The team
                    had
                    been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having
                    finished second in the league the previous season.[42] Ferguson had now been a manager for four
                    years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect
                    of
                    some of the older ones such as Joe Harper.[43] The season did not go especially well, with
                    Aberdeen
                    reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both
                    matches and finishing fourth in the league.</p>

                    <p>Aberdeen lost the 1979–80 Scottish League Cup Final, this time to Dundee United after a
                        replay.
                        Ferguson took the blame for the defeat, saying he should have made changes to the team for
                        the
                        replay.[44]</p>

                <h3><b>1980s and silverware</b></h3>
                <div class="textBlock">
                    Aberdeen had started the 1979–80 season poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new
                    year
                    and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5–0 win on the final day. It was the first
                    time
                    in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic. Ferguson now felt that
                    he
                    had the respect of his players, later saying "That was the achievement which united us. I
                    finally
                    had the players believing in me".[45]</p>

                    <p>He was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him "Furious
                        Fergie".[46]
                        He
                        fined one of his players, John Hewitt, for overtaking him on a public road,[47] and kicked a
                        tea
                        urn
                        at the players at half time after a poor first half.[48] He was dissatisfied with the
                        atmosphere
                        at
                        Aberdeen matches, and deliberately created a "siege mentality" by accusing the Scottish
                        media of
                        being biased towards the Glasgow clubs, to motivate the team.[49] The team continued their
                        success
                        with a Scottish Cup win in 1982. Ferguson was offered the manager's job at Wolverhampton
                        Wanderers
                        but turned it down as he felt that Wolves were in trouble[50] and his "ambitions at Aberdeen
                        were
                        not even half fulfilled".[51]</p>

                <div class="textBlock">
                    Ferguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season, 1982–83. They had qualified for
                    the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and
                    impressively knocked out Bayern Munich,[52][53] who had beaten Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in the previous
                    round.[54][55] According to Willie Miller, this gave them the confidence to believe that they could
                    go on to win the competition,[56] which they did, with a 2–1 victory over Real Madrid in the final
                    on 11 May 1983.[57] Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and
                    Ferguson now felt that "he'd done something worthwhile with his life".[58] This was followed up with
                    victory in the European Super Cup in December 1983, when Hamburger SV, the reigning European Cup
                    champions, were beaten 2–0 over two legs.[59][60] Aberdeen had also performed well in the league
                    that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a 1–0 victory over Rangers,[61] but Ferguson was not
                    happy with his team's play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a
                    "disgraceful performance" in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later
                    retracted.[62]</p>

                    <p>After a sub-standard start to the 1983–84 season, Aberdeen's form improved and the team won the
                        Scottish league and retained the Scottish Cup. Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the Order of
                        the
                        British Empire (OBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours,[63][64] and was offered the managers' jobs at
                        Rangers and Arsenal during the season.[65][66][67] Aberdeen retained their league title in the
                        1984–85 season, but had a disappointing season in 1985–86, finishing fourth in the league,
                        although
                        they did win both domestic cups. Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors
                        early
                        in 1986, but that April he told Dick Donald, their chairman, that he intended to leave that
                        summer.[citation needed]</p>

                    <p>Ferguson had been part of coaching staff for the Scottish national side during qualifying for the
                        1986 World Cup, but manager Jock Stein had collapsed and died on 10 September 1985 – at the end
                        of
                        the game in which Scotland qualified from their group for a play-off against Australia. Ferguson
                        promptly agreed to take charge of the Scottish national side against the Australians and
                        subsequently at the World Cup. To allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed
                        Archie
                        Knox as his co-manager at Aberdeen. However, after Scotland failed to progress past the group
                        stages
                        of the World Cup, Ferguson stepped down as national team manager on 15 June 1986.[68]</p>

                    <p>Around this time, Tottenham Hotspur offered Ferguson the chance to take over from Peter Shreeves
                        as
                        manager, but he rejected this offer and the job went to Luton Town's David Pleat instead. There
                        was
                        also an offer for Ferguson to replace Don Howe as Arsenal manager, but he rejected this offer as
                        well, and fellow Scot George Graham took the post instead.[69] That summer, there had been
                        speculation that he would take over from Ron Atkinson at Manchester United, who had slumped to
                        fourth in the English top flight after a ten-match winning start had made title glory seem
                        inevitable.[citation needed]</p>

                    <p>It was not the first time that Ferguson had been linked with a move to England. In February 1982,
                        Wolverhampton Wanderers had approached him about succeeding John Barnwell as manager as they
                        were
                        heading for relegation from the First Division.[70] He rejected this offer, perhaps concerned
                        about
                        the club's financial stability, as they were more than £2 million in debt at the time and
                        narrowly
                        avoided going out of business. At the end of the 1984–85 season, it was reported that Ferguson
                        was
                        being considered for the Liverpool manager's job after the retirement of Joe Fagan was
                        announced,
                        but the job was quickly accepted by Liverpool striker Kenny Dalglish.[71]
                        Although Ferguson remained at Aberdeen over the summer, he did eventually join Manchester United
                        when Atkinson was sacked in November 1986.[72]</p>

            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Ferguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986. He was initially worried that
                    many of the players,
                    such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was
                    "depressed" by their level of
                    fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to
                    finish the season in
                    11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.</p>

                <p>His first game in charge was a 2–0 defeat at Oxford United on 8 November, followed seven days
                    later by a goalless
                    draw at newly promoted Norwich City, and then his first win (1–0 at home to Queens Park Rangers)
                    on 22 November.
                    Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be
                    their only away win of
                    the league campaign at title challengers and deadly rivals Liverpool on Boxing Day, it was clear
                    that United were on
                    the road to recovery. 1987 began on a high note with a 4–1 victory over Newcastle United and
                    United gradually pulled
                    together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and
                    finished 11th in the
                    final table. Ferguson's mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his
                    appointment. Ferguson
                    hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.</p>

                <p>In the 1987–88 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including Steve Bruce, Viv Anderson,
                    Brian McClair and
                    Jim Leighton. The new players made a great contribution to a United team who finished in second
                    place, nine points
                    behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the
                    season and while
                    United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games and there was clearly
                    still some way to go
                    before United could be a match for their north western rivals.</p>

                <p>During the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the Bermuda national
                    team and the Somerset
                    Cricket Club.In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox
                    took to the
                    field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson's only appearance for
                    the Manchester United
                    first team.</p>

                <p>United were expected to do well when Mark Hughes returned to the club two years after leaving for
                    Barcelona, but the
                    1988–89 season was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1–0 at
                    home to Nottingham
                    Forest in the FA Cup sixth round. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match
                    winless run throughout
                    October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results
                    took them to third
                    place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of
                    disappointing results in the
                    final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.</p>

                <p>For the 1989–90 season, Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for
                    midfielders Neil Webb,
                    Mike Phelan, and Paul Ince, as well as defender Gary Pallister and winger Danny Wallace. The
                    season began well with
                    a 4–1 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly
                    turned sour. In
                    September, United suffered a humiliating 5–1 away defeat against fierce rivals Manchester City.
                    Following this and
                    an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, "Three
                    years of excuses and
                    it's still crap ... ta-ra Fergie." was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and
                    supporters called for
                    Ferguson to be sacked.[74][75] Ferguson later described December 1989 as "the darkest period [he
                    had] ever suffered
                    in the game", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.</p>

                <p>Following a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham
                    Forest in the third
                    round of the FA Cup. Forest were performing well that season and were in the process of winning
                    the League Cup for
                    the second season running,[78] and it was expected that United would lose the match and Ferguson
                    would consequently
                    be sacked, but United won the game 1–0 due to a Mark Robins goal and eventually reached the
                    final. This cup win is
                    often cited as the match that saved Ferguson's Old Trafford career, even though it has since
                    been stated that his
                    job was never at risk.[78][79][80] United went on to win the FA Cup, beating Crystal Palace 1–0
                    in the final replay
                    after a 3–3 draw in the first match, giving Ferguson his first major trophy as Manchester United
                    manager. United's
                    defensive frailties in the first match were unilaterally blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton,
                    forcing Ferguson to drop
                    his former Aberdeen player and bring in Les Sealey.</p>

            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Although United's league form improved greatly in 1990–91, they were still inconsistent and
                    finished sixth. There
                    were some excellent performances that season, including a 6–2 demolition of Arsenal at
                    Highbury,
                    but results like an
                    early 2–1 loss at newly promoted Sunderland, a 4–0 September hammering by Liverpool at
                    Anfield,
                    and a 2–0 home
                    defeat by Everton in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect Ryan Giggs
                    made
                    his senior debut)
                    showed that United still had some way to go.</p>

                <p>Even after the FA Cup victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's
                    ability to succeed
                    where all the other managers since Matt Busby had failed – to win the league title.[80] They
                    were runners-up in the
                    League Cup, losing 1–0 to Sheffield Wednesday. However, they won the European Cup Winners'
                    Cup,
                    beating that
                    season's Spanish champions Barcelona 2–1. It would be United's only Cup Winners' Cup title.
                    After the match,
                    Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he
                    seemed
                    to have won over
                    the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.[81]</p>

                <p>During the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become
                    assistant to Walter
                    Smith, and Ferguson promoted youth team coach Brian Kidd to the role of assistant manager in
                    Knox's place. He also
                    made two major signings – goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and defender Paul Parker – to bolster
                    his
                    side. There was much
                    anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored
                    once in the 1990–91
                    campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of Lee
                    Sharpe, who despite their
                    youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a
                    new
                    player to take over
                    from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder
                    Andrei Kanchelskis to the
                    right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders Mike Phelan and
                    Bryan
                    Robson.</p>

            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>
                <p>The 1993–94 season brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old
                    midfielder Roy Keane to the
                    ranks for a British record fee of £3.75 million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson,
                    who
                    was nearing the end
                    of his career.[85] United led the 1993–94 Premier League table virtually from start to
                    finish.
                    Ferguson was the
                    first winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award, introduced for the start of
                    the
                    1993–94 season, when
                    he collected the accolade for August 1993. Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all
                    competitions despite being
                    sent off twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup
                    final
                    but lost 3–1 to
                    Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final,
                    Manchester
                    United achieved an
                    impressive 4–0 scoreline against Chelsea, winning Ferguson his second League and Cup Double,
                    following his Scottish
                    Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984–85, though the League Cup
                    final
                    defeat meant that he
                    had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.</p>
                <p>Ferguson made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn £1.2 million for David May.
                    There
                    were newspaper
                    reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton
                    from
                    Norwich City, but
                    the player headed for Blackburn instead. 1994–95 was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona
                    assaulted a Crystal
                    Palace supporter in a game at Selhurst Park, and it seemed likely he would leave English
                    football. An eight-month
                    ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison
                    sentence for the offence
                    but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order.
                    United paid a British
                    record fee of £7 million for Newcastle United's prolific striker Andy Cole, with young
                    winger
                    Keith Gillespie
                    heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players
                    Gary Neville, Nicky
                    Butt and Paul Scholes, who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were
                    left
                    without some of their
                    more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp
                    as
                    they drew 1–1 with
                    West Ham United on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third
                    successive league title.
                    United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1–0 defeat by Everton.</p>
                </p>

            <h3 id="1995–98"><a href="#agenda" style="text-align: center">1995–98</a></h3>
            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Ferguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players
                    were allowed to leave and
                    replacements were not bought. First Paul Ince moved to Internazionale of Italy for £7.5
                    million, long-serving
                    striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a £1.5 million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was
                    sold to Everton. Ferguson
                    felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The
                    youngsters, who would
                    be known as "Fergie's Fledglings", included Gary Neville, Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul
                    Scholes and Nicky Butt,
                    who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the 1995–96 season began
                    without a major signing, at
                    a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with
                    big-money
                    signings.[citation needed]</p>

                <p>A youthful United team lost 3–1 in their opening league game of the 1995–96 season, against
                    Aston Villa.[86] On
                    Match of the Day, pundit Alan Hansen criticised their performance, ending his analysis with
                    the words, "You can't
                    win anything with kids."[87] United won their next five matches and were boosted by the
                    return of Cantona, who made
                    his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995. For much of the season, the team trailed
                    league leaders Newcastle
                    and found themselves ten points behind by Christmas; this later was narrowed to seven points
                    after defeating them on
                    27 December 1995. The gap increased to 12 points, but a series of wins, coupled with
                    Newcastle dropping points,
                    meant by late March, United moved to the top of the table. In a televised outburst after his
                    team's win against
                    Leeds, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan responded angrily to Ferguson's comments: "We're still
                    fighting for this
                    title, and he's got to go to Middlesbrough ... I would love it if we beat them, love
                    it."[88] A win against
                    Middlesbrough on the final day sealed the title for United and the team beat Liverpool by a
                    goal to nil to win the
                    1996 FA Cup Final; this was their second double in three years. A week after the cup final,
                    Ferguson agreed a
                    four-year contract to remain at United.[89]</p>

                <p>United started the following season thrashing the previous year's league runners-up Newcastle
                    4-0 in the Charity
                    Shield. They went on to win their fourth league title in five seasons at the end of the
                    1996–97 campaign, made
                    easier by the fact that their rivals were "not up to the job".[90] Under Ferguson, the team
                    made a better go in the
                    Champions League and reached the semi-final stage for the first time in 28 years.[91] United
                    did not advance any
                    further, after defeat by Borussia Dortmund of Germany.[92] Norwegian signings Ole Gunnar
                    Solskjær and Ronny Johnsen
                    were the notable additions to the squad, with the former ending the season as the club's top
                    goalscorer. In May
                    1997, Cantona informed Ferguson of his decision to retire from football.[93] The player
                    "felt exploited by United's
                    merchandising department" and questioned the ambition of the club, reasons which Ferguson
                    understood.[93] Striker
                    Teddy Sheringham was signed as Cantona's replacement from Tottenham Hotspur, with Blackburn
                    defender Henning Berg
                    the other significant purchase that summer.[94][95] In the close season, United appointed
                    Keane as their new
                    captain. Ferguson described him as "the best all-round player in the game" after the team's
                    1997 FA Charity Shield
                    win and believed Keane had "all the right ingredients" to succeed from Cantona.[96]</p>

                <p>Defeat by Leeds United in September 1997 was the team's first league loss in seven months;
                    Keane during the match
                    injured himself and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with ligament
                    damage.[97] Goalkeeper Peter
                    Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence. By November, United opened up a four-point
                    lead in the league,
                    which prompted talk of whether any team could catch them.[98] After Arsenal's defeat of
                    United in the same month,
                    Ferguson acknowledged a one-horse race was "not good for the game" and admitted his
                    opponents "... deserved to win
                    on their second-half performance".[99] The fallibilities of Liverpool, Chelsea and Blackburn
                    as league challengers
                    allowed United during the winter to extend their lead by 11 points, albeit with Arsenal
                    having games-in-hand.[100]
                    This was enough for Manchester bookmaker Fred Done to pay out on punters who backed the
                    champions retaining their
                    title.[101]</p>

                <p>Arsenal collected maximum points, sealing the title with a win against Everton on 3 May 1998.
                    Ferguson congratulated
                    his opponent Arsène Wenger, who in his first full season at the club, later completed the
                    double: "I think it's good
                    for my young players to lose on this occasion. I wholeheartedly acknowledge what Arsenal
                    achieved between Christmas
                    and the end of the season."[102] United straight after paid £10.75 million for PSV defender
                    Jaap Stam, a new club
                    record fee.[103] Ferguson wanted to strengthen the squad's attacking options and identified
                    Aston Villa's Dwight
                    Yorke as his main target.[104] Attempts to sign Yorke were rebuffed at first, before
                    Ferguson persuaded Edwards to
                    increase United's initial offer of £10 million.[105] A £12.6 million deal was reached a week
                    into the league
                    campaign; Yorke signed minutes before the deadline to submit United's squad for the
                    Champions League.[105]</p>

                        Shield.[106] The beating did not
                        concern Ferguson, though he described his team's defeat by Arsenal in September 1998 as
                        "a
                        lot less tolerable". In
                        December 1998, Kidd left his role as assistant to become the manager of Blackburn
                        Rovers.
                        Ferguson instructed Eric
                        Harrison and Les Kershaw to find suitable replacements, "in terms of coaching ability
                        and
                        work ethic." Both
                        recommended Steve McClaren, the assistant to Jim Smith at Derby County. McClaren was
                        Ferguson's initial choice and
                        appointed him in February 1999. His first game as assistant was United's 8–1 victory
                        over
                        Nottingham
                        Forest.[107]</p>

                    <p>Ferguson felt United's bid to regain the Premier League began indifferently because of
                        their
                        commitments to other
                        competitions. He was willing to "pay for the progress" made in the Champions League; the
                        team finished second in
                        their Champions League "group of death", behind Bayern Munich and ahead of Barcelona.</p>
                    <p>Under Ferguson, United acclaimed a treble of trophies in the 1998–99 season.
                        In the final weeks of the league season, Arsenal emerged as a creditable challenger to
                        United. Both clubs were also
                        paired together in the semi-final of the FA Cup, decided by a replay as the original
                        game
                        finished goalless. Keane
                        was sent off in the second half and United conceded a penalty late into the match with
                        the
                        score 1–1. Dennis
                        Bergkamp's effort was saved by Peter Schmeichel.[110] Ferguson hoped his team "could at
                        least take it to a penalty
                        shoot-out", but instead the match was settled in extra time: Giggs ran the length of the
                        pitch and evaded several
                        Arsenal players to score the winning goal.[109] United went on to beat Newcastle United
                        in
                        the FA Cup final and
                        completed the double – a week earlier the team had regained the Premiership
                        title.[109]</p>

                    <p>United's progression in the Champions League was promising compared to previous seasons.
                        The
                        team eliminated Inter
                        Milan at the quarter-final stage and faced Juventus in the last four of the competition.
                        A
                        late goal scored by Giggs
                        in the first leg earned the team a 1–1 draw, but in spite of conceding an away goal,
                        Ferguson was adamant of
                        United's chances of reaching the final: "... something tells me we are going to win. The
                        nature of our club is that
                        we torture ourselves so much that the only way to get relief is by winning over
                        there."[111]
                        At the Stadio delle
                        Alpi, striker Filippo Inzaghi scored twice to put Juventus 3–1 up on aggregate.[112]
                        Keane
                        headed in a Beckham cross
                        to halve the deficit just before half-time, but was later shown a yellow card for a foul
                        on
                        Edgar Davids, which
                        prevented him from playing in the final.[112] Yorke equalised, before Cole added a third
                        to
                        win the match
                        outright.[112] Keane's performance merited praise from Ferguson:</p>

                    <p>It was the most emphatic display of selflessness I have seen on a football field.
                        Pounding
                        over every blade of
                        grass, competing if he would rather die of exhaustion than lose, he inspired all around
                        him.
                        I felt it was an honour
                        to be associated with such a player.[109]</p>

                    <p>Days after the FA Cup final, United travelled to Barcelona, the setting for the UEFA
                        Champions League final.
                        Ferguson contemplated his team selection against Bayern Munich; suspensions to Scholes
                        and
                        Keane ruled both players
                        out of the match.[109] Beckham was positioned in centre midfield, while Giggs moved to
                        the
                        right wing and Blomqvist
                        started on the left – changes the manager felt would prevent the opposition from playing
                        narrow.[109] United
                        conceded in the first six minutes of the final, from a Mario Basler's free kick.
                        Sheringham,
                        who came on for
                        Blomqvist, equalised from a corner in the first minute of additional time. McClaren told
                        Ferguson to get the team
                        organised for extra time, to which he replied, "Steve, this game isn't finished."[109]
                        Three
                        minutes into added
                        time, Solskjær scored the winner, which for United completed an unprecedented treble.
                        Ferguson, interviewed moments
                        after, said, "I can't believe it. Football, bloody hell. But they never gave in and
                        that's
                        what won it." He and
                        Schmeichel, the stand-in captain, jointly lifted the cup during the trophy
                        presentation.[citation needed]</p>

                    <p>A crowd of over 500,000 people turned out on the streets of Manchester to greet the
                        players,
                        who paraded through the
                        city in an open-top bus.[113] As European champions, United were invited to play in the
                        Intercontinental Cup. The
                        club also entered the inaugural Club World Championship, which was held in Brazil. This
                        brought about a potential
                        fixture congestion so United accepted the FA's recommendation of withdrawing from the FA
                        Cup, the first holders to
                        do so.[114] In later years, Ferguson elaborated on the club's decision: "We did it to
                        help
                        England's World Cup bid.
                        That was the political situation. I regretted it because we got nothing but stick and
                        terrible criticism for not
                        being in the FA Cup when really, it wasn't our fault."</p>
