<h3 id="ManchesterUnited">The team of the era "Manchester United"</h3>
<img src="../image/mu.png" alt="Manchester United">

<h3 id="FACup"><a href="#agenda">Appointment and first FA Cup title</a></h3>
<p>Ferguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986. He was initially worried that many of the players,
	such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was "depressed" by their level of
	fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in
	11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.</p>

<p>His first game in charge was a 2–0 defeat at Oxford United on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless
	draw at newly promoted Norwich City, and then his first win (1–0 at home to Queens Park Rangers) on 22 November.
	Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of
	the league campaign at title challengers and deadly rivals Liverpool on Boxing Day, it was clear that United were on
	the road to recovery. 1987 began on a high note with a 4–1 victory over Newcastle United and United gradually pulled
	together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the
	final table. Ferguson's mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson
	hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.</p>

<p>In the 1987–88 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including Steve Bruce, Viv Anderson, Brian McClair and
	Jim Leighton. The new players made a great contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points
	behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while
	United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games and there was clearly still some way to go
	before United could be a match for their north western rivals.</p>

<p>During the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the Bermuda national team and the Somerset
	Cricket Club.In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox took to the
	field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson's only appearance for the Manchester United
	first team.</p>

<p>United were expected to do well when Mark Hughes returned to the club two years after leaving for Barcelona, but the
	1988–89 season was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1–0 at home to Nottingham
	Forest in the FA Cup sixth round. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout
	October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third
	place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the
	final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.</p>

<p>For the 1989–90 season, Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders Neil Webb,
	Mike Phelan, and Paul Ince, as well as defender Gary Pallister and winger Danny Wallace. The season began well with
	a 4–1 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In
	September, United suffered a humiliating 5–1 away defeat against fierce rivals Manchester City. Following this and
	an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, "Three years of excuses and
	it's still crap ... ta-ra Fergie." was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for
	Ferguson to be sacked.[74][75] Ferguson later described December 1989 as "the darkest period [he had] ever suffered
	in the game", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.</p>

<p>Following a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham Forest in the third
	round of the FA Cup. Forest were performing well that season and were in the process of winning the League Cup for
	the second season running,[78] and it was expected that United would lose the match and Ferguson would consequently
	be sacked, but United won the game 1–0 due to a Mark Robins goal and eventually reached the final. This cup win is
	often cited as the match that saved Ferguson's Old Trafford career, even though it has since been stated that his
	job was never at risk.[78][79][80] United went on to win the FA Cup, beating Crystal Palace 1–0 in the final replay
	after a 3–3 draw in the first match, giving Ferguson his first major trophy as Manchester United manager. United's
	defensive frailties in the first match were unilaterally blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton, forcing Ferguson to drop
	his former Aberdeen player and bring in Les Sealey.</p>


<h3 id="European"><a href="#agenda">United's European firsts and Ferguson's seconds</a></h3>
<p>Although United's league form improved greatly in 1990–91, they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There
	were some excellent performances that season, including a 6–2 demolition of Arsenal at Highbury, but results like an
	early 2–1 loss at newly promoted Sunderland, a 4–0 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2–0 home
	defeat by Everton in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect Ryan Giggs made his senior debut)
	showed that United still had some way to go.</p>

<p>Even after the FA Cup victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's ability to succeed
	where all the other managers since Matt Busby had failed – to win the league title.[80] They were runners-up in the
	League Cup, losing 1–0 to Sheffield Wednesday. However, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup, beating that
	season's Spanish champions Barcelona 2–1. It would be United's only Cup Winners' Cup title. After the match,
	Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he seemed to have won over
	the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.[81]</p>

<p>During the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become assistant to Walter
	Smith, and Ferguson promoted youth team coach Brian Kidd to the role of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also
	made two major signings – goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and defender Paul Parker – to bolster his side. There was much
	anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990–91
	campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of Lee Sharpe, who despite their
	youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over
	from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder Andrei Kanchelskis to the
	right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders Mike Phelan and Bryan Robson.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="Double"><a href="#agenda">1993–95: Double win and loss</a></h3>
<p>
<p>The 1993–94 season brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder Roy Keane to the
	ranks for a British record fee of £3.75 million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end
	of his career.[85] United led the 1993–94 Premier League table virtually from start to finish. Ferguson was the
	first winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award, introduced for the start of the 1993–94 season, when
	he collected the accolade for August 1993. Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being
	sent off twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3–1 to
	Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an
	impressive 4–0 scoreline against Chelsea, winning Ferguson his second League and Cup Double, following his Scottish
	Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984–85, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he
	had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.</p>

<p>Ferguson made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn £1.2 million for David May. There were newspaper
	reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton from Norwich City, but
	the player headed for Blackburn instead. 1994–95 was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona assaulted a Crystal
	Palace supporter in a game at Selhurst Park, and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month
	ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence
	but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order. United paid a British
	record fee of £7 million for Newcastle United's prolific striker Andy Cole, with young winger Keith Gillespie
	heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players Gary Neville, Nicky
	Butt and Paul Scholes, who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their
	more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1–1 with
	West Ham United on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title.
	United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1–0 defeat by Everton.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="1995–98"><a href="#agenda">1995–98</a></h3>
<p>
<p>Ferguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and
	replacements were not bought. First Paul Ince moved to Internazionale of Italy for £7.5 million, long-serving
	striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a £1.5 million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton. Ferguson
	felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The youngsters, who would
	be known as "Fergie's Fledglings", included Gary Neville, Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt,
	who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the 1995–96 season began without a major signing, at
	a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money
	signings.[citation needed]</p>

<p>A youthful United team lost 3–1 in their opening league game of the 1995–96 season, against Aston Villa.[86] On
	Match of the Day, pundit Alan Hansen criticised their performance, ending his analysis with the words, "You can't
	win anything with kids."[87] United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made
	his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995. For much of the season, the team trailed league leaders Newcastle
	and found themselves ten points behind by Christmas; this later was narrowed to seven points after defeating them on
	27 December 1995. The gap increased to 12 points, but a series of wins, coupled with Newcastle dropping points,
	meant by late March, United moved to the top of the table. In a televised outburst after his team's win against
	Leeds, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan responded angrily to Ferguson's comments: "We're still fighting for this
	title, and he's got to go to Middlesbrough ... I would love it if we beat them, love it."[88] A win against
	Middlesbrough on the final day sealed the title for United and the team beat Liverpool by a goal to nil to win the
	1996 FA Cup Final; this was their second double in three years. A week after the cup final, Ferguson agreed a
	four-year contract to remain at United.[89]</p>

<p>United started the following season thrashing the previous year's league runners-up Newcastle 4-0 in the Charity
	Shield. They went on to win their fourth league title in five seasons at the end of the 1996–97 campaign, made
	easier by the fact that their rivals were "not up to the job".[90] Under Ferguson, the team made a better go in the
	Champions League and reached the semi-final stage for the first time in 28 years.[91] United did not advance any
	further, after defeat by Borussia Dortmund of Germany.[92] Norwegian signings Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Ronny Johnsen
	were the notable additions to the squad, with the former ending the season as the club's top goalscorer. In May
	1997, Cantona informed Ferguson of his decision to retire from football.[93] The player "felt exploited by United's
	merchandising department" and questioned the ambition of the club, reasons which Ferguson understood.[93] Striker
	Teddy Sheringham was signed as Cantona's replacement from Tottenham Hotspur, with Blackburn defender Henning Berg
	the other significant purchase that summer.[94][95] In the close season, United appointed Keane as their new
	captain. Ferguson described him as "the best all-round player in the game" after the team's 1997 FA Charity Shield
	win and believed Keane had "all the right ingredients" to succeed from Cantona.[96]</p>

<p>Defeat by Leeds United in September 1997 was the team's first league loss in seven months; Keane during the match
	injured himself and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with ligament damage.[97] Goalkeeper Peter
	Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence. By November, United opened up a four-point lead in the league,
	which prompted talk of whether any team could catch them.[98] After Arsenal's defeat of United in the same month,
	Ferguson acknowledged a one-horse race was "not good for the game" and admitted his opponents "... deserved to win
	on their second-half performance".[99] The fallibilities of Liverpool, Chelsea and Blackburn as league challengers
	allowed United during the winter to extend their lead by 11 points, albeit with Arsenal having games-in-hand.[100]
	This was enough for Manchester bookmaker Fred Done to pay out on punters who backed the champions retaining their
	title.[101]</p>

<p>Arsenal collected maximum points, sealing the title with a win against Everton on 3 May 1998. Ferguson congratulated
	his opponent Arsène Wenger, who in his first full season at the club, later completed the double: "I think it's good
	for my young players to lose on this occasion. I wholeheartedly acknowledge what Arsenal achieved between Christmas
	and the end of the season."[102] United straight after paid £10.75 million for PSV defender Jaap Stam, a new club
	record fee.[103] Ferguson wanted to strengthen the squad's attacking options and identified Aston Villa's Dwight
	Yorke as his main target.[104] Attempts to sign Yorke were rebuffed at first, before Ferguson persuaded Edwards to
	increase United's initial offer of £10 million.[105] A £12.6 million deal was reached a week into the league
	campaign; Yorke signed minutes before the deadline to submit United's squad for the Champions League.[105]</p>


</p>
<h3 id="Treble"><a href="#agenda">1998–99: Treble success</a></h3>
<p>United opened the 1998–99 season with a 3–0 loss to Arsenal in the 1998 FA Charity Shield.[106] The beating did not
	concern Ferguson, though he described his team's defeat by Arsenal in September 1998 as "a lot less tolerable". In
	December 1998, Kidd left his role as assistant to become the manager of Blackburn Rovers. Ferguson instructed Eric
	Harrison and Les Kershaw to find suitable replacements, "in terms of coaching ability and work ethic." Both
	recommended Steve McClaren, the assistant to Jim Smith at Derby County. McClaren was Ferguson's initial choice and
	appointed him in February 1999. His first game as assistant was United's 8–1 victory over Nottingham
	Forest.[107]</p>

<p>Ferguson felt United's bid to regain the Premier League began indifferently because of their commitments to other
	competitions. He was willing to "pay for the progress" made in the Champions League; the team finished second in
	their Champions League "group of death", behind Bayern Munich and ahead of Barcelona. United's win against Liverpool
	in the FA Cup fourth round was a portent for the remainder of the season. A goal down after three minutes, the team
	equalised in the 86th minute and scored the winning goal through Solskjær in stoppage time.[108] On reflection,
	Ferguson said it was "a demonstration of the morale that was to be every bit as vital as rich skill in the five
	months that lay ahead of United".[109]</p>


<p>Under Ferguson, United acclaimed a treble of trophies in the 1998–99 season.
	In the final weeks of the league season, Arsenal emerged as a creditable challenger to United. Both clubs were also
	paired together in the semi-final of the FA Cup, decided by a replay as the original game finished goalless. Keane
	was sent off in the second half and United conceded a penalty late into the match with the score 1–1. Dennis
	Bergkamp's effort was saved by Peter Schmeichel.[110] Ferguson hoped his team "could at least take it to a penalty
	shoot-out", but instead the match was settled in extra time: Giggs ran the length of the pitch and evaded several
	Arsenal players to score the winning goal.[109] United went on to beat Newcastle United in the FA Cup final and
	completed the double – a week earlier the team had regained the Premiership title.[109]</p>

<p>United's progression in the Champions League was promising compared to previous seasons. The team eliminated Inter
	Milan at the quarter-final stage and faced Juventus in the last four of the competition. A late goal scored by Giggs
	in the first leg earned the team a 1–1 draw, but in spite of conceding an away goal, Ferguson was adamant of
	United's chances of reaching the final: "... something tells me we are going to win. The nature of our club is that
	we torture ourselves so much that the only way to get relief is by winning over there."[111] At the Stadio delle
	Alpi, striker Filippo Inzaghi scored twice to put Juventus 3–1 up on aggregate.[112] Keane headed in a Beckham cross
	to halve the deficit just before half-time, but was later shown a yellow card for a foul on Edgar Davids, which
	prevented him from playing in the final.[112] Yorke equalised, before Cole added a third to win the match
	outright.[112] Keane's performance merited praise from Ferguson:</p>

<p>It was the most emphatic display of selflessness I have seen on a football field. Pounding over every blade of
	grass, competing if he would rather die of exhaustion than lose, he inspired all around him. I felt it was an honour
	to be associated with such a player.[109]</p>

<p>Days after the FA Cup final, United travelled to Barcelona, the setting for the UEFA Champions League final.
	Ferguson contemplated his team selection against Bayern Munich; suspensions to Scholes and Keane ruled both players
	out of the match.[109] Beckham was positioned in centre midfield, while Giggs moved to the right wing and Blomqvist
	started on the left – changes the manager felt would prevent the opposition from playing narrow.[109] United
	conceded in the first six minutes of the final, from a Mario Basler's free kick. Sheringham, who came on for
	Blomqvist, equalised from a corner in the first minute of additional time. McClaren told Ferguson to get the team
	organised for extra time, to which he replied, "Steve, this game isn't finished."[109] Three minutes into added
	time, Solskjær scored the winner, which for United completed an unprecedented treble. Ferguson, interviewed moments
	after, said, "I can't believe it. Football, bloody hell. But they never gave in and that's what won it." He and
	Schmeichel, the stand-in captain, jointly lifted the cup during the trophy presentation.[citation needed]</p>

<p>A crowd of over 500,000 people turned out on the streets of Manchester to greet the players, who paraded through the
	city in an open-top bus.[113] As European champions, United were invited to play in the Intercontinental Cup. The
	club also entered the inaugural Club World Championship, which was held in Brazil. This brought about a potential
	fixture congestion so United accepted the FA's recommendation of withdrawing from the FA Cup, the first holders to
	do so.[114] In later years, Ferguson elaborated on the club's decision: "We did it to help England's World Cup bid.
	That was the political situation. I regretted it because we got nothing but stick and terrible criticism for not
	being in the FA Cup when really, it wasn't our fault."</p>
